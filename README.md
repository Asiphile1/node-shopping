# Shopping List API

This is a simple API to manage a shopping list, which allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API is built using Node.js and interacts with a local JSON file to store and retrieve data.

## Features
- **GET** `/shopping-list`: Retrieve the list of shopping items.
- **POST** `/shopping-list`: Add a new item to the shopping list.
- **PUT** `/shopping-list/{id}`: Update an existing item by its ID.
- **DELETE** `/shopping-list/{id}`: Delete an item by its ID.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for running the server.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing tool (optional, but recommended).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone (https://github.com/Asiphile1/node-shopping/tree/main)
cd shopping-list-api
```


## 2. Install Dependencies
This project doesnâ€™t have any external dependencies, but if you need to add more later, use the following command:

```bash
Copy

npm init -y
```

## 3. Run the Server
To run the server, use the following command:

```bash
Copy

node api.js
```
The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## 4. Test the API Endpoints 
You can test the API using Postman or any API testing tool.

## 5. Error Handling
If a request is made with invalid data (e.g., a missing name field), the API will return a 400 status code with an error message:

```json

{
  "error": "Item must have a name"
}
```
If an invalid item ID is provided, the API will return a 404 status code with an error message:

```json

{
  "error": "Item not found"
}
```

## 6. Data Storage

The shopping list data is stored in a local JSON file located in the data/shoppingList.json file.
The API uses the fs module to read and write data to this file.
